    "_Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful_"

## What is MMI?

The **Market Mood Index (MMI)** is Tickertape's proprietary sentiment indicator that measures investor emotions in the Indian stock market.
It tracks market sentiment on a **scale of 0-100**, categorizing market mood into four distinct zones based on fear and greed psychology.

## Understanding the Four Zones

| Zone | Range | Description | Investment Signal |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Extreme Fear** | < 30 | Market oversold, widespread selling | **Good time to buy** |
| **Fear** | 30-50 | Cautious sentiment, trajectory dependent | Monitor trend direction |
| **Greed** | 50-70 | Optimistic market, overbought territory | **Consider selling** |
| **Extreme Greed** | > 70 | Market euphoria, avoid fresh positions | Wait for correction |

## Bull vs Bear: The Sentiment Connection

MMI's Fear/Greed zones directly correspond to traditional **Bull and Bear market sentiment**.
When MMI shows Fear zones, it reflects bearish sentiment (investors expecting market decline),
while Greed zones indicate bullish sentiment (optimism about market rises).

Like other sentiment indicators, MMI serves as a contrarian indicator - extreme readings often signal potential market reversals.

## How MMI Works

MMI is built using **6 fundamental factors**, each providing unique insights into market psychology:

- **FII Activity** - Foreign institutional investor sentiment
- **Volatility & Skew** - Market risk and direction expectations  
- **Momentum** - Price trend strength using moving averages
- **Market Breadth** - Stocks advancing vs declining ratio
- **Price Strength** - 52-week highs vs lows comparison
- **Gold Demand** - Safe haven vs equity preference
